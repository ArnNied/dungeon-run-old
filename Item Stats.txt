Verdict:
SWORD       : An all rounder between Hit Rate, Critical Rate, and Damage
RAPIER      : Lacks from high damage is negated by its strength in consistency and critical Rate
AXE         : A heavy hitter outclassing other weapons in the next tier but suffer from inconsistency and low Critical Rate

SHIELD      : An item to boost Parry Chance significantly (ACTIVE: PARRY)
ARMOR       : An item to increase resistance from incoming damage (PASSIVE)

POTIONS     : Healing item with low stats but excel in its number
G. POTIONS  : A better Potion but lacks in number
